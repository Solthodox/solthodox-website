## Rust

### ZKP Auth (Chaum-Pedersen Protocol Authentication Server)

- **Build Time**: 2 weeks of research + 1 week of development
- **Repository**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Solthodox/zkp-auth)

  ZKP Auth is a zero-knowledge-proof authentication server built with Rust. It
  enables users to prove their knowledge of a password without compromising the
  password itself. This is achieved using the Chaum-Pedersen protocol.
  Additionally, it implements a gRPC communication protocol for efficient
  requests.

### Zrush (Zero Knowledge Proof Blockchain)

- **Status**: In development...
- **Repository**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Solthodox/zrush)

Zrush is a zero-knowledge-proof-based blockchain protocol developed in Rust. It
focuses on preserving privacy while maintaining the core trustless nature of
blockchain technology.

## Solidity

### SolBin (Binary Solidity Snippets)

- **Build Time**: 3 weeks
- **Repository**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Solthodox/solbin)

SolBin is a Solidity library that provides a variety of utility functions for
working with binary numbers. It includes features like converting decimal
numbers to binary strings, bit counting, Hamming distance calculation, and more.
It is particularly useful for projects involving bitwise manipulation, such as
bitmaps and flags. SolBin also allows users to log the binary representation of
numbers, making it ideal for testing environments.

### Radxu CFA (Radxu Community Founder Accounts)

- **Build Time**: 3 months
- **Repository**: Private

Radxu Community Founder Accounts is a protocol of nodes that receive weekly
Radix token emissions for their contributions to the protocol. The goal is to
fund community-driven projects while preventing scams and unworthy projects from
receiving funds. Token emissions are periodically reduced through "halvings"
where emissions are halved.

### Radxu CSA (Radxu Community Shared Accounts)

- **Build Time**: 1 month
- **Repository**: Private
- **Dapp**: [Radxu CSA Dapp](https://app.radxu.org/)

Radxu Community Shared Accounts enables projects to secure funding by dividing
participation into CSA tokens. Profits generated can be used to pay dividends to
investors, similar to traditional CeFi stock shares.

### Radxu Staking

- **Build Time**: 2 weeks
- **Repository**: Private

Radxu Staking allows users to stake their Radix tokens efficiently and
cost-effectively to earn more tokens as rewards. It comprises three smart
contracts, each designed for different staking durations: 90 days, 180 days, and
360 days.

### P2P Lending Protocol MVP

- **Build Time**: 3 weeks
- **Repository**: Private

Developed for Koryntia Finance, the P2P Lending Protocol MVP represents the core
product of the Koryntia protocol designed to secure funding in the initial
investment round. This protocol facilitates peer-to-peer lending, where lenders
can customize debt conditions. Debt is represented as an NFT that can be
transferred to third parties.
